some simple programs I used MANY YEARS to make the figures in the
notes; I hope to make some modern python or julia code soon.

channels.cpp - this was for graphing the asymptotic values and time
constants against V

all the rest of the c++ code + Makefile - this was for plotting the HH spike, the main is Simulation.cpp for the spike I plotted, I used Simulation2.cpp because I wanted to play around with parameters a bit.

HH.py - a Brian code snippet I took from the Brian examples site just to look at how it worked.
